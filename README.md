DevClub IIT Delhi is organising DevClub Summer of Code 2023, so students can learn development together in the summers!
You can choose from any of the 4 tracks **App, Backend, Frontend, Machine Learning**. 

For each track, there will be a **4-week long project** on a common theme, divided into weekly guided assignments, where we will be providing resources so you can learn, build and showcase!

We will be giving attractive **rewards** to those who participate enthusiastically, and also **recruiting members** to join the DevClub Team!

Make sure to [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) latest changes whenever your fork falls behind ours. Later, you should install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), setup [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork on your local machine.
- Edit [`author.json`](author.json) to include your details so we can identify you. Feel free to include other details like `discord_id`, `phone_number`, `email_id` etc 
- Check out each **track** from their folder, and explore about them. You can try multiple tracks too!
- Each week, we will share **resources** to learn concepts for each track step-by-step, along with small **assignments** which will add up to a project
- We will also be having online lectures or discussion **sessions**, to help you learn better
- **Upload** your submissions for each week to the respective folder
- Join our **Discord** server for any queries, discussions, and to stay up-to-date!

## Aim
We aim to help students get started with learning coding and software development. The concepts for each **track** are divided into **weeks** pedagogically so you can learn step-by-step. 

No matter if you're a beginner or an expert, at each stage, you will be learning something new, and building something **useful** in real world. You will also be equipped with the skills and tools which would meet **most tech requirements**, and the final projects in each track will be good enough to be put in your **portfolio or CV**.

We are keeping the repository open to **everyone from around the world**, so everyone can use it to learn and share their ideas in the forks.

## Theme and Project
This year's theme is... <font size=7>**e-commerce**!</font> 

Buying and selling of good has been key to the _advent of civilization_, it is an ever-growing and ever-evolving field, both utilizing and driving latest innovations and technologies. 

Platforms today have made _buying_ new items quick and as simple as a click, but what do we do with all the old stuff?

The projects in each track will revolve around this theme, and we are planning to build a platform where students can **buy and sell items** to each other. 

## Rewards

  - From each track, we will be recruiting **executive members** for the DevClub Team
  - Certificates and **ECAs** to students who perform exceptionally well
- We will also be sharing **opportunities** relevant to the tools we have covered here, and your submissions can serve as a proof of your skills
- We will be showcasing the **best projects** in our Discord server and our social media handles

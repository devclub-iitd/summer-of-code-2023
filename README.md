# DevClub Summer of Code 2023

DevClub IIT Delhi is organising DevClub Summer of Code 2023, so students can learn development together in the summers!
You can choose from any of the 4 tracks **App, Backend, Frontend, Machine Learning**. 

For each track, there will be a **4-week long project** on a common theme, divided into weekly guided assignments, where we will be providing resources so you can learn, build and showcase!

We will be giving attractive **rewards** to those who participate enthusiastically, and also **recruiting members** to join the DevClub Team!

- **Tracks**
  - [App Development](app)
    - [Week 1](app/week1): Learn Flutter and build a UI using Stateful and Stateless Widgets
    - [Week 2](app/week2): Dive deeper into Flutter's Widgets by building ProductTile, Promoted product banners and implementing forms. Make the app dynamic and interactive!
  - [Backend Development](backend)
    - [Week 1](backend/week1): Learn how a backend works by analysing a real-world website, and then make your own backend, using raw Python & SQL and use it to create a simple URL shortener
    - [Week 2](backend/week2): Setup a Django backend server, and learn database models, rendering templates, user authentication and forms. Bonus: make it production-ready!
  - [Frontend Development](frontend)
    - [Week 1](frontend/week1): Learn how websites work using DevTools, and then learn how to build a simple static website using HTML and CSS, taking designs from Figma and host it on GitHub Pages
    - [Week 2](frontend/week2): Use Javascript to create a repository network analyzer consuming the GitHub API, and use Bootstrap to make our previous webpage responsive!
  - [Machine Learning](machine-learning)
    - [Week 1](machine-learning/week1): Set up an ML environment to run your code on GPUs, then select and build a price prediction model, and also scrape your own dataset for it from the web.
    - [Week 2](machine-learning/week2): Use YOLO to identify and describe items to be sold from the pictures, and fine-tune your Object Detection model using your own dataset

## How to Participate
- First of all, [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), if you haven't already! 
- [**Fork**](https://github.com/devclub-iitd/summer-of-code-2023/fork) this repository. This will give you a copy of this repository, where you can upload your work too. Make sure to [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) latest changes whenever your fork falls behind ours. Later, you should install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), setup [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork on your local machine.
- Edit [`author.json`](author.json) to include your details so we can identify you. Feel free to include other details like `discord_id`, `phone_number`, `email_id` etc 
- Check out each **track** from their folder, and explore about them. You can try multiple tracks too!
- Each week, we will share **resources** to learn concepts for each track step-by-step, along with small **assignments** which will add up to a project
- We will also be having online lectures or discussion **sessions**, to help you learn better
- **Upload** your submissions for each week to the respective folder
- Join our **Discord** server for any queries, discussions, and to stay up-to-date!

## Aim
We aim to help students get started with learning coding and software development. The concepts for each **track** are divided into **weeks** pedagogically so you can learn step-by-step. 

No matter if you're a beginner or an expert, at each stage, you will be learning something new, and building something **useful** in real world. You will also be equipped with the skills and tools which would meet **most tech requirements**, and the final projects in each track will be good enough to be put in your **portfolio or CV**.

We are keeping the repository open to **everyone from around the world**, so everyone can use it to learn and share their ideas in the forks.

## Theme and Project
This year's theme is... <font size=7>**e-commerce**!</font> 

Buying and selling of good has been key to the _advent of civilization_, it is an ever-growing and ever-evolving field, both utilizing and driving latest innovations and technologies. 

Platforms today have made _buying_ new items quick and as simple as a click, but what do we do with all the old stuff?

The projects in each track will revolve around this theme, and we are planning to build a platform where students can **buy and sell items** to each other.

# DevClub Summer of Code 2023

## App Development

#### Why learn this?

1. **Engagement:** People are more likely to be engaged when they have an app installed on their device. Having an app icon visible on the home screen serves as a constant reminder of your brand or service. Additionally, push notifications can be utilized to send timely and personalized updates, prompting users to interact with the app more frequently.

2. **Access to Device Features:** Apps have direct access to a device's hardware and software features, which allows for more extensive and seamless integration. This enables developers to create innovative functionalities and experiences that go beyond the capabilities of web-based applications. Whether it's utilizing the camera, geolocation features, or using biometric authentication methods, apps offer greater access to device features.

3. **Enhanced Security:** Apps can benefit from the built-in security mechanisms and features provided by the operating system. These include permissions management, secure storage, and encryption options. By utilizing these native security measures, developers can ensure the protection of user data and mitigate potential security risks.

4. **Personalization:** Apps allow for greater personalization options based on user preferences, behavior, and location. By collecting and analyzing user data, apps can provide personalized content, recommendations, and user interfaces tailored to individual preferences.

#### Why Flutter?

1. **Single Codebase:** Flutter's ability to create apps for multiple platforms ensures broader market reach and compatibility. By building a single codebase, developers can simultaneously target Android, iOS, web, desktop, and more, reaching a wider audience.

2. **Developer Experience:** Flutter offers an extensive library of pre-designed and customizable widgets. These ready-to-use widgets simplify development and reduce effort and time of developers. With the flexibility and customizability offered by Flutter, developers have the freedom to design and fine-tune their app's appearance and behavior according to their specific requirements. This level of control and adaptability empowers developers to create beautiful and unique user experiences, elevating the quality of their apps.

3. **Developer Support:** Flutter provides robust developer support through its active presence on platforms like GitHub, Discord, and various online communities. Developers can seek assistance, share ideas, and collaborate with fellow Flutter enthusiasts. Moreover, Flutter's ease of developing new packages and plugins encourages innovation, allowing developers to extend the platform's functionality effortlessly.

4. **Beauty of Dart and Google Prioritization:** This makes flutter an appealing choice for app developers. With its clean syntax and modern features, Dart enables efficient development and code maintenance. Google's support, exemplified by frameworks like Flutter, fosters a vibrant ecosystem, providing resources and cross-platform capabilities. This combination empowers developers to create high-quality apps with elegance and productivity.

### Week 1

- #### Concepts
1. **Setting up Flutter and Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** Start by installing Flutter and setting up Visual Studio Code on your local PC. This will ensure a seamless Flutter app development experience. Additionally, we will introduce you to essential VSCode extensions specifically tailored for Flutter development, enhancing your coding experience.

2. **Widgets: Stateless and Stateful:** Learn about the concepts of stateless and stateful widgets, which are the building blocks of Flutter UIs. Understand the differences between them and when to use each. Create visually appealing layouts using widgets such as Column, Row, Scaffold, Container, and others.

3. **Lists and Grids:** Explore working with lists and grids to manage dynamic data. Learn how to create scrollable lists and grids using Flutter widgets, improving the organization and efficiency of displaying and interacting with data in your app.

4. **Form and Validation:** Forms play a vital role in capturing user input. We will cover the process of building forms in Flutter, including form validation techniques to ensure accurate data submission. You will learn how to create input fields, validate user input, and provide real-time feedback.

5. **Introduction to pub.dev:** Discover pub.dev, a central repository for Flutter packages. Learn how to search, evaluate, and integrate packages into your Flutter projects. Find ready-to-use components and utilities that can enhance your app's functionality.

- #### [Task](week1)
This assignment will allow you to apply your Flutter skills with Marketplace Design Exploration, Product Listing Implementation, Product Details and Interaction, and Cart Functionality.


### Week 2

- #### Concepts
1. **Custom Widgets:** Take the initiative to create custom widgets that align with the design and functionality of our marketplace app. These widgets should encapsulate specific UI components or reusable elements, promoting code reusability and modularity. Experiment with different Flutter widget types such as `Container`, `Card`, `FlatButton`, or `CustomPaint` and customize them according to the desired visual style and behavior of our app.

2. **PageView Builder:** Implement a dynamic PageView builder that enables users to swipe between different banners displayed in our app. Utilize the `PageView` widget to showcase promoted banners with smooth transitions. Apply the builder pattern to dynamically generate the content of each page, ensuring flexibility in our user interface.

3. **Forms and Input Validation:** Take the initiative to implement forms that capture user input and perform input validation. Focus on creating a form that allows users to provide necessary details when posting a product for sale. Utilize Flutter's form widgets, such as `TextFormField` and `FormFieldValidator`, to manage user input and maintain data integrity. Implement validation logic to verify the correctness of entered data, including checking for required fields and enforcing length limitations.

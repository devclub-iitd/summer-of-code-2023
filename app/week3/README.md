## App Development: Week 3 

Here are the tasks for week 3 â€”

1. **Integrating RESTAPIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE):** 
Utilize a provided API endpoint to make a GET request and retrieve the product data in JSON format, deserialize the JSON data into Dart Objects and create an appealing user interface that showcases the fetched products in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. Use the similar concepts for POST request.

# DevClub Summer of Code 2023

## Frontend Development

#### Why learn this?

The first impression of any organisation or product goes through how well their website looks. A great frontend both looks easy on the eyes, and helps the users get the right information from the webpage. To make an engaging website, you should understand the underlying features provided by the browser, to optimise how your webpage loads and looks.

#### What we'll be building?

We'll start by learning how to make simple webpages, and then we'll build an **e-commerce portal** where users would be able to buy and sell items!

### Week 1
- #### Concepts
- HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup for web pages. A markup language is an encoding system which consists of a set of symbols which when inserted in text control it's structure. HTML is based on markup meta languages XML and SGML. Meta languages are used to define a documents structure and the relation between it's parts rather than how it will be displayed. Thus colors, padding, position, etc are rarely specified in HTML. 

- CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS can be used to separately control layout, color and font of different elements. 

It can be added in the HTML file (inline) or be linked separately in a style sheet. 
In case of multiple styles, in line take preference over an external style sheet. 

- DevTools
Built right inside your browser, this provides the most powerful set of tools to a frontend developer for understanding how a webpage is working!

- GitHub Pages

This is a service provided by GitHub where we can host our static files easily and it gets updated on each push too!

### Week 2 
- #### Concepts 
- Javascript
Javascript is the programming language which runs on the web! Today, it also powers many backend servers and user applications. We use Javascript on the frontend to add logic to our webpage to make it interactive, using both Browser APIs and Web APIs.

- Bootstrap 
Bootstrap is the world's most popular framework for building responsive, mobile first sites. It utilises SaaS, a pre-built grid and powerful Javascript plug-ins. Saas is a scripting language that is compiled into CSS. Due to its structured syntax and additional features Saas is preferred over CSS.

# DevClub Summer of Code 2023

## Machine Learning

#### Why learn this?
Today, mankind faces many problems that have no definitive solution or hard coded answers. The problems we face today are multifaceted, and require perspectives and different ways of thinking, and iterative improvement over our current solutions. In this sense, trying to find patterns within the current data that we have become one of the key strategies of going about and solving these problems. The field that accomplishes this is Machine Learning.

Most industries working with large amounts of data have recognised the value of Machine Learning technology. By gleaning insights from this data – often in real time – organisations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors. Some of the industries that have adopted this technology include the public sector, e-commerce, healthcare, and finance. As a result, in the status quo, ML has become one of the most coveted fields, and offers a wide variety of job opportunities with great potential for career growth.

#### What we'll be building?
This year the theme for DevClub Summer of Code is e-commerce! We will be building various ML functionalities associated with e-commerce websites, such as price prediction models, query-redressal chatbots, object-tagging models to identify and isolate objects in images. We will predominantly be using python for this.

    "# Image Augmentation Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This documentation provides an overview of the image augmentation code, which performs augmentation on a collection of input images. The code incorporates multithreading, batch processing, and optimized memory usage to enhance efficiency and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Overview\n",
    "The code can be divided into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Importing Required Libraries\n",
    "- `os`: For file and directory operations.\n",
    "- `csv`: For writing data to a CSV file.\n",
    "- `numpy`: For numerical operations.\n",
    "- `PIL`: For image manipulation.\n",
    "- `rembg`: For background removal.\n",
    "- `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`: For multithreading support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Setting Input and Output Directories\n",
    "- `input_dir`: The directory containing the input images.\n",
    "- `output_dir`: The directory to store the augmented images.\n",
    "- `csv_file`: The path to the CSV file for storing augmented data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Creating the Output Directory\n",
    "- Checks if the output directory exists. If not, it creates the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Configuring Rotation Parameters\n",
    "- `min_angle`: The minimum rotation angle (in degrees).\n",
    "- `max_angle`: The maximum rotation angle (in degrees).\n",
    "- `angle_increment`: The increment value for rotation (in degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Setting Batch Size\n",
    "- `batch_size`: The number of images to be processed in each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Initializing Augmented Data List\n",
    "- Creates an empty list to store augmented image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Function to Process a Batch of Images\n",
    "- The `process_batch` function takes a batch of filenames as input.\n",
    "- Iterates over each filename and performs image processing tasks.\n",
    "- Resizes the image, removes the background, rotates it, and saves the augmented images.\n",
    "- Stores the augmented data in a batch-specific list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Processing Images in Batches\n",
    "- Iterates over the input images in batches.\n",
    "- Collects a batch of filenames and passes them to the `process_batch` function.\n",
    "- Uses multithreading with `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process multiple batches concurrently.\n",
    "- Collects the augmented data from each batch and appends it to the `augmented_data` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Writing Augmented Data to CSV File\n",
    "- Opens the CSV file in write mode.\n",
    "- Creates a CSV writer object.\n",
    "- Writes the header row.\n",
    "- Writes the augmented data rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Removing Resized Images\n",
    "- Removes the resized images (prefixed with \"resized_\") to clean up the output directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The image augmentation code efficiently performs augmentation on a collection of input images. It utilizes multithreading and batch processing to parallelize image processing tasks, optimizing performance. Additionally, the code incorporates optimized memory usage to handle large datasets. The augmented images are saved in the specified output directory, and the augmented data is recorded in a CSV file. This code provides flexibility, scalability, and improved efficiency in generating augmented image datasets.\n"

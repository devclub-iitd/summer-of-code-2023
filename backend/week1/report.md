## Login Process in Moodle

1. The browser initiates a POST request to ```https://moodle.iitd.ac.in/login/index.php``` with the login credentials and other necessary data.
2. The server responds with a status code of 303 See Other, indicating a redirection.
3. The browser follows the redirect and sends a GET request to ```https://moodle.iitd.ac.in/login/index.php?testsession=49144```.
4. The server responds with a status code of 303 See Other, indicating another redirection.
5. The browser follows the second redirect and sends a GET request to ```https://moodle.iitd.ac.in/my/```.
6. The server responds with a status code of 200 OK, indicating a successful request.

## Cookies and Authentication

Cookies are used in the browser-server communication to maintain stateful communication, session management, and authentication. In Moodle, the following cookies are used:
- MoodleSession: This cookie stores the session ID, allowing the server to associate subsequent requests with the user's session.
- MOODLEID1_: This cookie is used for authentication and is assigned a unique value for each user.

The cookies are sent by the browser in the Cookie header with each subsequent request, allowing the server to identify and authenticate the user. The server sets the cookies in the Set-Cookie header in the server responses, instructing the browser to store and send them in future requests.

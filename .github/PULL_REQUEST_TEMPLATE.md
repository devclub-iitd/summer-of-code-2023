  - [ ] [Week 2](machine-learning/week2): Use YOLO to identify and describe items to be sold from the pictures, and fine-tune your Object Detection model using your own dataset
  - [ ] [Week 3](machine-learning/week3): Develop a model that automatically detects, aligns, and enhances images uploaded by sellers in an online marketplace, using techniques such as image recognition, rotation, and image enhancement
  - [ ] [Week 4](machine-learning/week4): Develop a chatbot designed for a marketplace website, capable of effectively addressing and resolving buyer queries and complaints, by utilizing a well-organized dataset, NLP frameworks and integration for a seamless user experience
